# HydroXtremes

This repository containing all code, data, and figures associated with the study of projected changes in extreme hydrologic flood and drought events under future climate scenarios.

This repository includes:
- Scripts for data processing and analysis  
- Code for generating the figures featured in the associated research article  
- The script used to build the accompanying Streamlit web application  

The data includes hydrologic extremes (duration, magnitude, and intensity) across various climate scenarios, seasons, and time slices. 
You can explore these visualizations through the interactive app hosted here:
